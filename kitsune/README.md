# Kitsune-1.0
Kitsune is a strapping Stylus & Json centric Css Js framework with the view to be highly community driven & extensible, components will be interchangeable and you will be able to manage the entire src via a nwjs app or dedicated small app on server. We encourage forks of Kitsune to be released as Distrobutions of Kitsune so that they can be listed on the Kitsune website when we make it..
